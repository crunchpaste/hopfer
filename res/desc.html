    Hopfer is a simple <a style="color: salmon;" href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt6</a> app meant as a companion to my PhD thesis on halftoning algorithms for print writen almost exclusively in Python and using <a style="color: salmon;" href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a> and <a style="color: salmon" href="https://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a> for acceleration.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 125%;">The app is named after <a style="color: salmon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hopfer">Daniel Hopfer</a> â€“ an early German blacksmith-turned-printmaker, mostly known for his technical achievements, especially the invention of etching. That's the reason I probably went a bit overboard with the logo.</p>

  <p style="line-height: 125%;">
    Keep in mind <b>hopfer</b> is still in its very early stages of developement so expect bugs and crashes.
