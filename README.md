**hopfer** is a Python-based GUI application that implements a wide range of halftoning algorithms from scratch, primarily designed for printmaking purposes.

The application uses Qt6 for the GUI and implements the halftoning algorithms using NumPy and Numba for much better performance.

This project was originally created as a companion to my PhD thesis on digital halftoning methods for analog printmaking techniques.

## Features

- **Wide range of halftoning algorithms**: Implementations of various halftoning methods tailored for printmaking.
- **GUI built with Qt6**: Easy-to-use graphical interface to interact with the halftoning algorithms.
- **Algorithm acceleration**: Utilizes **NumPy** and **Numba** for fast execution of halftoning computations.
- **Multiplatform**: Currently works on Linux, future plans aim for cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS).

## Future Plans

- Add **more halftoning algorithms**.
- Introduce **basic image editing tools**.

Enjoy halftoning!
